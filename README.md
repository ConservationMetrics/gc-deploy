# `gc-stack-deploy`: Guardian Connector deployments for community partners

## Components of the Guardian Connector Stack

### üìÇ Storage for your Data Warehouse

Store, organize, and selectively share all your data. The warehouse consists of:

- a filesystem for media (pictures, maps, videos)
- a SQL Database for tabular data & surveys

### üñ•Ô∏è Compute

A computer server to run the software.

- a virtual machine in the cloud of your choice.

### üì¶ App stack

Deploy software easily with [CapRover](https://caprover.com/).

- **Windmill**: Sync from outside data providers, schedule your data workflows, and run other scripts.
- **Superset**: Visualize and explore structured/tabular data with interactive dashboards.
- **Filebrowser**: Easily view and create share links for your media (pictures, videos...).
- **GuardianConnector Explorer**: Unified view of tabular, media, and maps.
- **CoMapeo Archive Server**: A CoMapeo archive server that synchronizes with CoMapeo devices.
- ...plus you can install any other web-based software you want.

## High-level steps to spawn a new stack

1. Create your data warehouse: file storage & a SQL database.
    - NOTE: If you are deploying your SQL database or storing files on the VM directly, you do not need to do this step first.
    - A private repo [`gc-forge`](https://github.com/ConservationMetrics/gc-forge/blob/main/terraform/README.md) helps set this up on Azure, but but you do not need to use terraform or Azure.
2. If you plan on using auth0, set up an **auth0 tenant** with a user authorization workflow and client applications to help secure access to the apps you will deploy. See [`auth0/README.md`](auth0/README.md)
3. Deploy a VM.
    - [`azure/README.md`](azure/README.md) describes setting this up on Azure.
    - [`digitalocean-vm/README.md`](digitalocean-vm/README.md) describes setting up a VM with CapRover included on DigitalOcean.
    - With the right amount of knowledge, you can follow the above guides and/or CapRover's own [Getting Started](https://caprover.com/docs/get-started.html) guide to figure out how to deploy a VM on your hosting platform of choice.
4. Install the app stack by following [`caprover/README.md`](https://github.com/ConservationMetrics/gc-forge/blob/main/caprover/README.md).
5. Set up data pipelines & other scripts to run in Windmill.
